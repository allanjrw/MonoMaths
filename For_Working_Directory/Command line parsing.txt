THE NEW COMMAND LINE PARSING SYSTEM
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
DIRECTIVES conform to the usual rules of MonoMaths assignments. Notionally the LHS variables given below have all
	been predefined as scalar or array. (While LHS names not on the list won't crash anything, they will simply be ignored.)
	As for MM assignments, assignments must be terminated by ';' (though as with MM, the semicolon may be omitted after the last one).
	Also, spaces are ignored unless they are inside quotes.

	Quote mark: Although all 3 are usable from the point of view of MM code, you should always use [`] as (a) with 'exec()' you have
	to use [`], as the underlying C# routine helpfully removes the other two types of quote; and (b) with Xfce Launchers the same is true.

	As with MM, don't use quote marks for scalars (e.g. not "left = `20`;", as 'left' has been notionally predefined as a scalar).

	As usual for MM, directives are case-sensitive. Note that all abbreviated alternative forms are in capitals,
	while their expansions are always in small letters.
The program name itself does not take a semicolon; there is a space after it, and all after that space is parsed as mentioned above.

First Set  (scalar LHS variables)
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
  ('XX' for a real number; 'TXT' for text)
	left = XX;     -- OR --    L = XX;
	top = XX;     -- OR --    T = XX;
	width = XX;     -- OR --    W = XX;
	height = XX;     -- OR --    H = XX;
	topwindowheight = XX;     -- OR --    TWH = XX;  (NB -- unlike the above four, values below 1 are not taken as ratios. Use pixel size.)
	formatted;    [No '=', as stands alone; if present, MonoMaths opens in formatted-text mode. Also, no abbreviated form.] 
		Won't have any effect if there is no text, and consequently if not used in combination with 'load'.

Second Set (array LHS variables). One only of these should be supplied. Note that quote marks are essential.
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
	load = `TXT`; Path must be complete. Any later args. simply ignored.
	run = `TXT`;  Path must be complete. Any parameters to be passed to the new program must be enclosed  by the same quotes
	 as the file name. E.g.:
				run = `/home/jon/Foo/foo and bar.txt TWH = 23; formatted;`; (Any text between the inner " pair would be ignored;
							you could stick a comma there, if it made you feel better; or you could even do this, for full MM assmt compatibility:)
				run = text("/home/jon/Foo/foo and bar.txt", "TWH = 23; formatted;");
	NB - these parameters will be placed as the unicode representation of a string in the internal buffer which is accessed by 
			function "persistent_array()".

ERRORS
Any directive not conforming to one of the above will be ignored without raising an error or interrupting parsing of the rest of the line.⁻

TESTED EXAMPLES
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
1. USING 'EXEC':
exec("/home/jon/MonoMaths/MonoMaths.exe", "left = 0.05; top = 0.05; width = 0.9;  height = 0.9; topwindowheight = 600; formatted; load = `/home/jon/MonoMaths/Hints.txt`"); // Warning - takes around 10 seconds because of the 'formatted'.

2. COMMAND FOR XFCE LAUNCHER
This one is now installed in Panel 2 (the right-hand icon for MonoMaths):
mono /home/jon/MonoMaths/MonoMaths.exe L=0.085; T=0; W=0.8; H=0.94; TWH=650

3. THUNAR
In the directory "/home/jon/.local/share/applications/" should be something like "userapp-mono-UESCQX.desktop" to run MonoMaths.
The following works fine there: 
	Exec=mono /home/jon/MonoMaths/MonoMaths.exe L=0.115; T=0; W=0.75; H=0.94; load=`%f`
