GENERAL POINTS
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
Directives are all followed by a semicolon (like all statements in MonoMaths programs).
Spaces are ignored, unless inside quote marks (as would be a file name).
Three quotation mark types are allowed (which must be paired):  "  '  `  (the last is usually on the top left key of the keyboard).
In general, the third is safest, as some external programs that handle the MonoMaths call (e.g. file browser) may interpret
	the other two quote marks in their own way, and so divide up your intended command line into segments.
	Quote marks are only used for character strings; they should not be used around numerical values.
There are two sets of directives; the first set sizes the MonoMaths instance, and defines how it handles formatted text.
	The second set deal with loading and possibly running a program in the new MonoMaths instance.
	The second set MUST follow the first set. Any first set instruction after a second set instruction would simply be ignored.


First Set  (all arguments are numerical values)
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
Abbreviations used in descriptions below: 'XX' stands for a numerical value; 'TXT' stands for a character string.
For the first four, values < 1 are taken as proportions of the relevant screen dimension; values > 1 are taken as pixel sizes.

	left = XX;     -- OR --    L = XX;
	top = XX;     -- OR --    T = XX;
	width = XX;     -- OR --    W = XX;
	height = XX;     -- OR --    H = XX;
	topwindowheight = XX;     -- OR --    TWH = XX;  [Use pixel size only.]
	formatted;    [No argument. If present, MonoMaths opens in formatted-text mode. Only applies if a 'load' instruction follows.] 


Second Set (One only of these two. Note that quote marks are essential; the back-sloped apostrophe is safest to use.)
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
	load = `TXT`; [Path must be complete.]
	run = `TXT`;  [Path must be complete.]

In the case of 'run' you can supply command line arguments which the MonoMaths program itself will use.
E.g.:	run = `/home/jon/Foo/foo and bar.txt TWH = 23; formatted;`; [and when program 'foo and bar' starts up in the new MonoMaths instance,
							it will read the last two arguments and react accordingly.]

ERRORS
Any directive not conforming to one of the above will be ignored without raising an error or interrupting parsing of the rest of the line.⁻

EXAMPLES OF USE
⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻⁻
1. USE INSIDE A MONOMATHS PROGRAM, USING SYSTEM FUNCTION'EXEC':
exec("/home/jon/MonoMaths/MonoMaths.exe", "left = 0.05; top = 0.05; width = 0.9;  height = 0.9; topwindowheight = 600; formatted; load = `/home/jon/MonoMaths/Hints.txt`"); // Warning - takes around 10 seconds because of the 'formatted' argument, as 'Hints.txt' is a big file.

2. COMMAND FOR DESKTOP APPLICATION LAUNCHER
This one is now installed in an Xfce desktop panel on my computer; it invokes 'mono' to run a MonoMaths instance with dimensions as given:
	mono /home/jon/MonoMaths/MonoMaths.exe L=0.085; T=0; W=0.8; H=0.94; TWH=650;
